        <p>I selected this one as he best episode because it has a very satisfying narrative arc.  It contains a few hints of foreshadowing and some little details that you only notice after you go back and watch it a second time.  The episode is also highly satifying because it focuses on the only non-bender in the entire group, Sokka.</p>
