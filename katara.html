            <p>Katara found Aang in the iceberg with her brother, Sokka.  Once they learn that he is the Avatar, they set out to find Aang teachers so that he can master all four elements.  Katara is a waterbender, but she doesn't have much training at first.  Over the series she develops her potential and becomes a powerful waterbender.</p>
