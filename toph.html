            <p>Toph Beifong is 12 years old and blind, but don't let that fool you.  She is the greatest earthbender alive and sees by feeling vibrations in the ground.  Toph becomes Aang's earthbending teacher.  Toph has a fighting spirit and likes pranking people.  She is somewhat gruff at times, but friendly as a whole.</p>
