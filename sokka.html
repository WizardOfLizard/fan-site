            <p>Sokka found Aang in the iceberg with his sister, Katara.  Sokka is the only nonbender in the entire group, but he is adept with his boomerang and later, his sword.  Sokka is sarcastic and often the butt monkey of the universe.  He is clever and humorous.  Regardless of all of this, he still cares deeply for his sister.</p>
